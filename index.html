        <p style="color: aliceblue;"> 14.2.1 PC performance assessment benchmark The PC computer architecture performance test utilized is comprised of 22 individual benchmark tests that are available in six test suites.</p> 
     <p style="color: azure;">
        <ul type="disc" style="color: aliceblue;"> 
     <li>Integer and floating-point mathematical operations </li>
     <li>Tests of standard two-dimensional graphical functions    </li>
     <li>Reading, writing, and seeking within disk files    </li>
     <li>Memory allocation and access    </li>
     </ul> </p>
       <P style="color: azure;">he test results reported are shown as relative values
      . The larger the number the faster the computer. For example, 
        a computer with a result of 40 can process roughly twice as much data
      as a computer with a result of 20. The Passmark rating is a weighted
        average of all the other test results and gives a single overall
       indication of the computer's performance.
     The bigger the number the faster the computer.</P>
